Introduction:

Welcome to my Happyplace.
Here I will continue to all my artworks and other stuff i create.
why? Because making stuff makes me happy, and i want to share my happyness as much as i can.
Im not a huge fan of social medias like instagram so im not very active there. 
This is where my Happyplace comes in. All mine and no likes or comments.


1 Features:

Navigation Bar: Complete with links to my pages, identical on each page for easy navigation. 
Who wants to have to press 'back' if you dont have to, just click where you want to go.


Landing page image: The image is the first page of one of my favourite books, the first page to let
you into my world of magical colours.


Mediums: A short description of the mediums i use in my art. 
Why? Someone might find it useful.


The "colouring" page is for my pages I've given life to. Used both as a gallery and as inspiration for new projects.

The "creations" page is for the craftier side of my creativity. I have to many to give all of them their own page so they will share. 



2 Future ideas:
Someday i might consider opening a shop to sell some of the stuff i make. It wont happen now, but this will be the perfect space to do so.


3 Technologies used:
I honestly dont know what this means. 


4 Testing: 
I have sent the webpage to several friends to test on different phones, tablets and browsers. 
It works well on everything I've tested, but looks best on bigger screens. 
I've also done the W3C validator and Jigsaw validator.

5 Bugs:
The webpage loads very slow because of all the images, but I do not want to lessen their quality as a lot of work went into all the details on them.

6 Deployment:
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

So easy even i could do it. 

7 Credits:
I have had a lot of help on this project from my mentor, and a classmate Johan Ingvarsson has been my personal programming duck.
My sisters Laila and Viatrix for endless pepptalks and cheerleading.
My cousin Ted who made me interested in programming to begin with.

8 Media:
All the images are coloured by me, and I've taken the pictures of the images. 
All the mermaid drawings are from CAMILLA d'ERICO's colouringbook, the others are from a lot of different books but her images are my favorites.
The winter tree i use as background was planted by my sister 35 years ago, picture taken by me.
My creations are made and photografed by me.
I make as much as possible myself so i know i have permission to use what i have.
