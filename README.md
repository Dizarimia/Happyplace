Introduction:

Welcome to my Happyplace.
Here I will continue to all my artworks and other stuff I create.
Why? Because making stuff makes me happy, and I want to share my happiness as much as I can.
I'm not a huge fan of social media like Instagram, so I'm not very active there. 
This is where my Happyplace comes in. All mine and no likes or comments.


1 Features:

Navigation Bar: Complete with links to my pages, identical on each page for easy navigation. 
Who wants to have to press 'back' if you don't have to, just click where you want to go.


Landing page image: The image is the first page of one of my favourite books, the first page to let
you into my world of magical colours.


Mediums: A short description of the mediums I use in my art. 
Why? Someone might find it useful.

Video: A short, relaxing video of waves against the beach.

The "colouring" page is for my pages I've given life to. Used both as a gallery and as inspiration for new projects.

The "creations" page is for the craftier side of my creativity. I have to many to give all of them their own page, so they will share. 

Footer: Link to my Instagram for contact. 



2 Future ideas:
Someday I might consider opening a shop to sell some of the stuff I make. It won't happen now, but this will be the perfect space to do so.
I might give every picture its own page with all info on it, but that would be far in the future.


3 Technologies used:
I've used both HTML and CSS.


4 Testing: 
I have sent the webpage to several friends to test on different phones, tablets and browsers. 
It works well on everything I've tested, but looks best on bigger screens. 
I've also done the W3C validator and Jigsaw validator.
I've also used a spellchecker since English isn't my first language. 
Specifically checked spelling in British because to me that's the real English.

The large images is the main issue.


5 Bugs:
The webpage loads very slow because of all the images, but I do not want to lessen their quality as a lot of work went into all the details on them. Will work on solution.

6 Deployment:
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found here - https://dizarimia.github.io/Happyplace/index.html

So easy, even I could do it. 

7 Credits:
I have had a lot of help on this project from my mentor, and my classmate Johan Ingvarsson has been my personal programming duck.
My sisters Laila and Viatrix for endless pep talks and cheerleading.
My cousin Ted, who made me interested in programming to begin with.

I used the template I made for love running as a base for this website.
I also used https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template because it makes life easier.
Table of content order and help with information: https://github.com/dhakal79/readme-template.

8 Media:
All the images are coloured by me, and I've taken the pictures of the images. 
All the mermaid drawings are from CAMILLA d'ERICO's colouring book, the others are from a lot of different books, but her images are my favourites.
The winter tree I use as background was planted by my sister 35 years ago, picture taken by me.
My creations are made and photographed by me.
I make as much as possible myself, so I know I have permission to use what I have.
The video was filmed by me, credit to the ocean for being mesmerizing.

The features on index are the zooming picture to draw interest, medium text to explain some basics for new artists and a video for soothing the brain.

Includes a lot of colouring pictures for ideas and inspiration.

This is where the rest of my creativity shows, and hopefully it sparks the users creativity too.
